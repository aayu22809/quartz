# Week 9: Voice
![[Tone of Font.jpg | 2em]]
A lot of factors can go into []
- Tone = Chicken
	- *Tone* - The authors attitude towards what they're writing.
- Vocabulary = Broth
- Sentence structure
- Rhythm, cadence
	- Like the punctuation, sentence variety / repetition (short to the point or gracefully exadurant)
- Pacing

The **mood** is the intended tone that the reader percives

The mood im getting is that:

<pre>
	it might help to take a step back,
	to take a breather from the headache

	And once you give your mind
	a short pause from the overdrive,
	you free from the ritualistic conforms

	and notice the the moments, small
	luxuries, miracles. The grass
	that existed just by the side of the town
</pre>
The odd "sparkling iridescent loofa of a soul" phrase gives a odd insight into the deep personalities that people have, the angelic that every soul beholds.


# Week 9: Voice Practice

Scurrying, flight at the sight of the villainous gross that is he. The omniscient body crawls towards your physical depiction and your conscious mind roots to it's primitive ways of thought.
Babbling, screaming, secreting... hallways rubbing rusty grime to your back and passages with enough clearance for a gnome. "It mustn't be the way this ends!" your desperate cry echos back to no one but your pitiful, lone self.

The bright streets lights flicker in the pupils of my eyes. My coach would be proud if he were here on the Walk of Fame, seeing me sprint. Cops usually are just tryna get through the day and LA cops are no different. The last thing they want is to be going though a rusty abandoned Johnny Rockets 2 hours from midnight. They wives sure ain't gonna be happy thats for sure. Sirens wheeze. "Five and a half foot brown male running down First street... just took a right on Auzerais." I rush towards the back alleyway of the old milkshake house. Place used to be filled to the brim with people. Now all you see is a couple rats inside the fudge machine nibbling at the remanence of half decomposed caramel.
