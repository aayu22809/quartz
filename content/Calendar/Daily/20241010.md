## [[Memoir]] Examples
### Rangoli - D. T.

This one really spoke to me. It was about an indian girl talking about her experience of Rangoli.

- 2nd paragraph was deep and resonated with me
	- mothers wrinkels
	- too in the present to care
- **Kaal kare so aaj kar, aaj kare so ub** was the resonating line throughout the memoir

### Tying the Knot - Cherry Guo

This memoir was partially relatable

- Cooking and spending time with grandma
- The respect that you have to deliver to your parents and follow what they say usually without question
	- luckily not so much for me, we're more chill
- Growing up with your grandma and losing her is kinda hard to deal with
- My first language growing up was Gujarati not english and I would often have trouble talking in english during kindergarden and the first half of 1st grade.
