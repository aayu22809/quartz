[[Summer Before Sophmore Year]]
07 - 13 Sat 3xSMP
Calm waves lapped against the shore of Eilen Donan, the sound random, but intentional. It reminded you of something–maybe a distant memory of a lake, a place where time stopped, and the world waited between each ripple. 

Productivity tips had always seemed like marketing fluff, skincare for the soul. Yet, you sat there that evening, intrigued staring at the the so-called *Supernote*. A notebook promising clarity. Pen in hand. Cap clicks. The connection is made instant–the world fades away as ink meets paper.

If there was anything in the world that could cultivate as much devotion, it was that. The past few days using this system *felt* different– you were getting this done, but the productivity wasn't everything. The deliberate act of writing by hand, each stroke a delicate ripple, each word a contest of thought.
