Many people think they have a 2-day weekend. I beg to differ. Fridays are the best days of the week. Think about last Friday. you notice the sense of calamity and relief from the bricked up schedules just as you leave the campus you work.

It's more than just a time of being free, though. The joyous mood is reflected on everyones faces. Your project is accepted, the person who you admire strikes up a conversation with you, and you're of to plan your weekendâ€“ oh TopGolf is the vibe I'm hearing?
