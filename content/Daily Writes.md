Lub-dub, Lub-dub, lub… lub — is that what it feels to skip a heart beat? Sensations that of a poignant creature crawling down the spine. I walk down Bellagio’s lobby, towards the registrar. The expansive white heaven widens, scattered with gold and crystal.  A fountain of As I walked towards before meeting up with them filled my chest with a numbness. His silhouette rises the other end of the table, the blur of a chatter dissipates to indiscernible noise. I shut my eyes as a luminous beam struck my face from the expansive floor-ceiling windows across. I adore the look of golden hour shine on my face, though stares piercing from around the oval don’t tell the same story.
