# Chemistry Honors Chapter 4-Five Quiz

This cram study session will prioritize key concepts by spending more time on high-yield topics such as electron configuration, periodic trends, and bonding, while also covering naming, formulas, and calculations in a structured way. We’ll use **active recall** through deep, holistic questions and practice problems to enhance retention, alternating between topics for variety. Breaks will be interspersed to maintain focus.

## 1. Electron Configuration & Orbital Diagrams (30 minutes)
>**Key Concept:** Understand how electrons are arranged in atoms and why electron configuration dictates chemical behavior.

### Definition
\[Ar] 4p<sup>1</sup>3d<sup>10</sup> *"copper"*
Electro.  configurations organize the electrons of a specific atom or ion in a readable format. These can be used for **bond identification**

### Active Recall/Practice:

>[!question]- Write out the electron configurations for elements: Carbon (C), Sulfur (S), and Chlorine (Cl).
>Carbon: 
>Sulfer:
>Chlorine

>[!question]- Predict the configuration for ions: S<sup>2-</sup> , Cl<sup>-</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>.
>Carbon: 
>Sulfer:
>Chlorine

>[!question]- Draw orbital diagrams for elements in periods 2-3
>



### Deep Questions:

1. How does electron configuration influence the reactivity of alkali metals vs noble gases?
2. Why does the 4s orbital fill before the 3d orbital, even though 3d is higher in energy?



## 2. Periodic Table & Periodic Trends (30 minutes)

  There are many trends that we notice as we move around the periodic table-- get familiar with it. Turns out that the funny people who were making science back in the good ol' days noticed patterns in atoms and thus, the periodic table was born.

• **Key Concept:** Trends in atomic/ionic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity across the periodic table.

- Atomic or ionic radius
	- moving left to right, the electrons stay in the **same** level and protons are added as well. This leads to a stronger pulling force towards the positive nucleus.
	- moving top to bottom it's quite intuitive, each row signifies a new principal energy level so obviously the size will increase. Electrons are farther away and theres less attraction. ~~*same reason why long distance never works out, they start mingling with other atoms electrons.*~~
- Ionization energy
	- Going left to right ionization energy increases because


### Active Recall/Practice:

• Predict the relative sizes of  *Na,  Na<sup>+</sup>, and  Mg<sup>2+</sup>*.
• Compare ionization energy between  *Li*  and  *Be* ;  *F*  and  *Cl* .
• Practice predicting electronegativity trends across periods and down groups.


### Deep Questions:
  
1. Why does ionization energy increase across a period but decrease down a group?
2. How does atomic radius change from left to right across a period, and why?


## 3. Bonding: Ionic vs Covalent (30 minutes)

• **Key Concept:** Recognize bonding types based on element types and predict bonding behavior.

  - If IE-difference **IE<sub>diff</sub> > 1.7**
	  - the bond is a **ionic bond** where the atom with larger IE steals the electron(s)
	  - they're between metals and non-metals
	  - these bonds are typically very strong and thus require a lot of energy to break, prob **>500C** to break em.
  - If **IE<sub>diff</sub> < 1.7**
	  - But the difference is **IE<sub>diff</sub> > 0.5** and both atoms are non-metals
		  - the bond is a **polar covenant** and the higher IE atom will hog the electron
		  - these are also quite strong, you usually need **>100C** to break em.
	- We end up with a **non-polar covenant bond** where electron(s) are equally shared
	- An if both are metals we end up with a **metalic bond**

In Normal ENGLISH:
1. in an ionic bond
2. _[_10:59 PM_]_
    one is so electronegative that it has enough power to steal an electron completely
3. _[_11:00 PM_]_
    then since one has a + charge and the other has a - charge
4. _[_11:00 PM_]_
    they are strongly attracted
5. _[_11:01 PM_]_
    covelants are when both are electronegative but are kinda equal in power. so the share the electron
6. _[_11:01 PM_]_
    sometimes one hogs it most of the time so u get polar covelant but mostly they share em
7. _[_11:01 PM_]_
    and metalic bonds you have low electronegativity so they all just give their electrons to a community pool
8. _[_11:02 PM_]_
    Thats why metals are so malluable
### Active Recall/Practice:

• Classify each as ionic or covalent:  NaCl ,  CO<sub>2</sub> ,  MgO ,  H<sub>2</sub>O .
• Name compounds from their formulas and write formulas for given names (e.g., Sodium chloride, Magnesium nitrate).


### Deep Questions:

  

1. How does electronegativity difference determine bond type?

2. Why do ionic compounds generally have higher melting points than covalent ones?

  

## 4. Empirical and Molecular Formulas, Percent Composition (30 minutes)

• **Key Concept:** Determine empirical and molecular formulas from percent composition and molar mass.

### Active Recall/Practice:

>[!question]- Determine the empirical formula for a compound that is 40% carbon, 6.7% hydrogen, and 53.3% oxygen.
>40.0g C = 3.3 mol C
>6.7g H = 6.6 mol H
>53.3g O = 3.3 mol O
>1 mol C : 2 mol H : 1 mol O
>Thus the formula is $__CH_2O__$

>[!question]- Calculate the molecular formula for a compound with an empirical formula CH<sub>2</sub>O and a molar mass of 180 g/mol.
>Well the empirical formula is CH<sub>2</sub>O and thus the molecular formula *generally* must be (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>.
>The molar mass for the empyricial gives us  $\frac{(12.01 + 2 * (1.01) + 16.00) = 30.03 g CH_2O}{mol CH_2O}$

### Deep Questions:

1. What is the difference between empirical and molecular formulas, and why might they differ for the same substance?

2. How can percent composition data be used to identify an unknown compound?


## 5. Hydrate Calculations (30 minutes)

• **Key Concept:** Calculate the formula of a hydrate from mass data, determining water loss upon heating.

Things to realize here is you are used to all the givens being presented ***very** obviously*. So if your brain is trained to recognize those patterns from years of math, **help it out!!!**
- Try to imagine the situation, write out the givens 
	- how much H<sub>2</sub>O was lost
	- how much of the salt is present
	- what are the molar masses of the salt and H<sub>2</sub>O?
- Reframe the question to something that makes more sense  *(e.g. when you're tasked to find the empirical formula of a hydrate all you're doing is finding the ratio between the salt and the water, the formula units to be specific)*
- 

### Active Recall/Practice:

• Practice: A 5.00 g sample of a hydrate of CuSO4 loses 2.00 g of water upon heating. What is the formula of the hydrate? *Return to the step-by-step breakdown above*

  

### Deep Questions:

  

1. Why is it important to consider the mass of water in hydrates when calculating molar mass?

  

## Review Strategy (10-15 mins at the end):

  

• Go back to the areas you felt weakest on during the session.

• Use flashcards for quick active recall of concepts (nomenclature, periodic trends, bonding types).

  

By adhering to this structured plan, you’ll cover all key topics and engage in active learning through practice and deep questioning, improving retention for your exam.
